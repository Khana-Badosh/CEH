# Bandit Level 0

## Goal
The goal of Level 0 is to log into the Bandit game server using SSH. 
> SSH (Secure Shell) is a protocol used to securely connect to a remote computer over a network. It enables logging into remote servers, executing commands remotely, transferring files securely, and encrypts all communication between your local machine and the remote system. In the Bandit wargame, SSH is how we access the remote Linux machine where each level is hosted.
